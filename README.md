# ServeMandu

A Home Solutions App using Flutter.


## About the App - Servemandu

With the advancement of technology, people have become accustomed to new methods and
techniques that makes our life easier. This project is an attempt to make household
services available at the fingertips of the users. In todayâ€™s busy and chaotic life, dealing with
household services like plumbing, carpentry, repairs, cleaning, etc. are major problems in the
urban areas. It is almost difficult to find such services and service providers when we move to
a new place. To work out this issue, we have planned an Android Application via which users
can search for the regular household services with ease. This application is designed to
provide the users from most of the basic home solutions like TV, fridge & AC repair, IT
Support, house cleaning, vehicle repair, plumber, carpenter, and even a beautician. The user is
asked to choose the service they require, after which they get to view the name, contact and
rating of the service providers nearby their location, whose services they can choose. After
selecting their preference, the user is required to provide their accurate address, and set the
date and time for the appointment. After the service has been provided, the users are asked to
provide their feedback about the service. The payment is either in online/offline mode. Users
can also view the sale and advertisement of the devices like TV, fridge & ACs when they
book those services. <br>
